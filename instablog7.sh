ango, after the rescue of Ajaka was crowned King while Alaafin Ajaka was sent into exile. During his reign, he had two generals: Timi Agbale Olofa-ina who could shoot arrows of fire and Gbonka who was equally powerful. Seeing how powerful these two generals grew, Sango followed Oya’s advice to get rid of them and sent them to govern the border towns. Timi left for Ede but Gbonka stayed back in Oyo to pose further treat and in his quest to destroy them both, Sango sent Gbonka to capture Timi.

Sango who believed that the fight between Timi and Gbonka in Ede was staged asked for a re-match in Oyo and Gbonka defeated Timi. Seeing as he couldn’t finish his two threats at once, Sango ordered that Gbonka should be burnt to ashes. This would be in fear of Gbonka finding out that Sango only wanted him dead. Mysteriously, Gbonka appeared after three days giving Sango ultimatum to vacate the throne.
