nly a few of the Baba-Mogba who did not go back knew the truth which is that Sango was attacked by Gbonka. Sango unwilling to fight varnished into thin air only to later appear in the sky with wrath and flaming fire to destroy Gbonka. The town peddling the rumor about him hanging himself also got a share of his wrath.

Myths have it that he didnâ€™t stop till he was appeased. Hence the popular saying OBAKOSO or OLUKOSO meaning the king did not hang. As created by the Baba-Mogba who knew the truth. Another faction said the name OBAKOSO or OLUKOSO is derived from the name of the place he won Gbonka to reign supreme.
